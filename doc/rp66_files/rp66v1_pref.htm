This standard was prepared by the API Subcommittee on Recommended 
Format for Digital Well Log Data.  The content is based on a concept 
and proposal originally submitted to API by Schlumberger Well Services. 
This publication was under jurisdiction of the American Petroleum 
Institute Production Department's Executive Committee on 
Drilling and Production Practices until June 1998, when
Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC) accepted its 
stewardship.
 </li><li>
This publication specifies a format for digital well log data, called 
here the Digital Log Interchange Standard (DLIS).  This format may 
be used for the recording of well log data on magnetic tape as well 
as on other storage media.
 </li><li>
Anyone may use this standard who desires to do so, subject to the
terms of the

API RP66 V1 was originally published by the API in May 1991 
with a clause indicating that it would not be considered 
an operative API styandard 
five years after its publication date, unless reaffirmed 
or republished.  
This document, POSC RP66 V1, is considered to be applicable 
indefinitely, i. e., until withdrawn or deprecated by
POSC, with no requirement for periodic reaffirmation or 
extension.

<h3><a name="NOTATION">
Notation: How Is This Document Written?</a></h3>
Numerous cases of unusual capitalization appear in this document.  
Capitalized terms have special, formal, technical connotations in a 
DLIS context; these terms do not retain 
their normal English connotations. 
 When such a special term is first introduced, it is italicized.
<p>
Acronyms are fully defined before they are used.
</p><p>
Many figures include comment numbers that associate a particular item 
with a comment that appears below the figure.  For example, 

<table border="3">

  <td><b>Label
